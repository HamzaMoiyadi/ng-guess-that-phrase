# Pages

- Pages here are modules that contain their own components, services, directives, pipes, etc, in addition to also using the components from the shareable modules (`src/app/modules/`)
- Each page will contain a screens folder which will contain the components for one use-case of that page.
- Example, a payments page will contain the screens of card-details, cart, shipping-details, etc.
